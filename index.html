                    The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not 
                    made by humans. Things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies and much 
                    more are part of nature. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Things 
                    that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called artifacts.

                    There are natural sciences that study different parts of nature, for example the 
                    science of ecology is about plants and animals as a whole, while biology studies 
                    every type of living thing. From one point of view, humans are a prime example of 
                    nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth. 
                    Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a day-to-day basis. 
                    Every part of nature – everything from the air outside to the dirt on the ground – is 
                    interdependent. Medicine studies humans in health and sickness. From another point of
                     view, humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. Nature is often seen by humans
                     as natural resources. People cut down trees, mine ores, and grow crops. Fires, cars, 
                     and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave 
                     nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about
                     what they should do. In the modern world, with many more people and many big cities,
                     these problems are becoming more serious. Nature, in the broadest sense, means the 
                     physical world as a whole. This is the meaning that physics, the study of nature 
                     (etymologically), takes.

                    A useful definition of natural is: "Happening or operating in accordance with the 
                    ordinary course of nature". Oxford Shorter English Dictionary says the word in this 
                    sense is first found in 1477.

                    Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the 
                    subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the Solar System, it is third 
                    closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall.
                     Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively 
                     narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.[7] 
                     Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to 
                     less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water 
                     oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited 
                     land in the Northern Hemisphere.

                    Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces 
                    of the original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually 
                    migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic
                     mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is 
                     composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the 
                     core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate
                     the geomagnetic field.
