    <!-- Inline Elements -->

    <!-- Defines a hyperlink.
    The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

    The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red

    Tip: If the <a> tag has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.

    Tip: A linked page is normally displayed in the current browser window, unless you specify another target.

    Tip: Use CSS to style links: CSS Links and CSS Buttons. -->
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>
    <!-- Defines an abbreviation or an acronym.
The <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".

Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. -->
    The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.
    <!-- Defines bold text.
The <b> tag specifies bold text without any extra importance.
Note: According to the HTML5 specification, the <b> tag should be used as a LAST resort when no other tag is more appropriate. The specification states that headings should be denoted with the <h1> to <h6> tags, emphasized text should be denoted with the <em> tag, important text should be denoted with the <strong> tag, and marked/highlighted text should be denoted with the <mark> tag.

Tip: You can also use the following CSS to set bold text: "font-weight: bold;". -->
    <p>This is normal text - <b>and this is bold text</b>.</p>
    <!-- Overrides the current text direction.
BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.

The <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction.
 -->
    <bdo dir="rtl"> This text will go right-to-left. </bdo>
    <!-- big & small -->
    <br />
    <big>hello</big><small>world!</small>
    <!-- Defines a single line break.
The <br> tag inserts a single line break.

The <br> tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.

The <br> tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag.

Note: Use the <br> tag to enter line breaks, not to add space between paragraphs. -->
    <p>
      To force<br />
      line breaks<br />
      in a text,<br />
      use the br<br />
      element.
    </p>
    <!-- Defines a clickable button.
The <button> tag defines a clickable button.

Inside a <button> element you can put text (and tags like <i>, <b>, <strong>, <br>, <img>, etc.). That is not possible with a button created with the <input> element!

Tip: Always specify the type attribute for a <button> element, to tell browsers what type of button it is.

Tip: You can easily style buttons with CSS! Look at the examples below or visit our CSS Buttons tutorial. -->
    <button type="button">Click Me!</button>
    <!-- Defines the title of a work.
The <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).

Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.

The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic. -->
    <p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edward Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>
    <!-- Defines a piece of computer code.
The <code> tag is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Tip: This tag is not deprecated. However, it is possible to achieve richer effect by using CSS (see example below).

Also look at:
Tag 	Description
<samp> 	Defines sample output from a computer program
<kbd> 	Defines keyboard input
<var> 	Defines a variable
<pre> 	Defines preformatted text -->
    <p>The HTML <code>button</code> tag defines a clickable button.</p>

    <p>
      The CSS <code>background-color</code> property defines the background
      color of an element.
    </p>
    <!-- Specifies a term that is going to be defined within the content.
The <dfn> tag stands for the "definition element", and it specifies a term that is going to be defined within the content.

The nearest parent of the <dfn> tag must also contain the definition/explanation for the term.

The term inside the <dfn> tag can be any of the following: -->
    <p>
      <dfn>HTML</dfn> is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      <dfn title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</dfn> is the standard markup
      language for creating web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      <dfn><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></dfn> is the
      standard markup language for creating web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      <dfn id="html-def">HTML</dfn> is the standard markup language for creating
      web pages.
    </p>
    <p>This is some text...</p>
    <p>This is some text...</p>
    <p>Learn <a href="#html-def">HTML</a> now.</p>
    <!-- Defines emphasized text.
The <em> tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress. -->
    <p>You <em>have</em> to hurry up!</p>

    <p>We <em>cannot</em> live like this.</p>
    <!-- Defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood.
The <i> tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

Use the <i> element only when there is not a more appropriate semantic element, such as:

    <em> (emphasized text)
    <strong> (important text)
    <mark> (marked/highlighted text)
    <cite> (the title of a work)
    <dfn> (a definition term)
 -->
    <p><i>Lorem ipsum</i> is the most popular filler text in history.</p>

    <p>
      The <i>RMS Titanic</i>, a luxury steamship, sank on April 15, 1912 after
      striking an iceberg.
    </p>
    <!-- Defines an image.
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

    src - Specifies the path to the image
    alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

Note: Also, always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.

Tip: To link an image to another document, simply nest the <img> tag inside an <a> tag (see example below). -->
    <img
      src="./samplePictures/Lighthouse.jpg"
      alt="Girl in a jacket"
      width="500"
      height="600"
    />
    <!-- Defines an input control.
The <input> tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data.

The <input> element is the most important form element.

The <input> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.

The different input types are as follows:

    <input type="button">
    <input type="checkbox">
    <input type="color">
    <input type="date">
    <input type="datetime-local">
    <input type="email">
    <input type="file">
    <input type="hidden">
    <input type="image">
    <input type="month">
    <input type="number">
    <input type="password">
    <input type="radio">
    <input type="range">
    <input type="reset">
    <input type="search">
    <input type="submit">
    <input type="tel">
    <input type="text"> (default value)
    <input type="time">
    <input type="url">
    <input type="week">

Look at the type attribute to see examples for each input type!

Tip: Always use the <label> tag to define labels for <input type="text">, <input type="checkbox">, <input type="radio">, <input type="file">, and <input type="password">. -->
    <form action="/action_page.php">
      <label for="fname">First name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" /><br /><br />
      <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" /><br /><br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
    <!-- Defines keyboard input.
The <kbd> tag is used to define keyboard input. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Tip: This tag is not deprecated. However, it is possible to achieve richer effect by using CSS (see example below).

Also look at:
Tag 	Description
<code> 	Defines a piece of computer code
<samp> 	Defines sample output from a computer program
<var> 	Defines a variable
<pre> 	Defines preformatted text -->
    <p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text (Windows).</p>

    <p>Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text (Mac OS).</p>
    <!-- Defines a labelÂ for an <input> element.
The <label> tag defines a label for several elements:

    <input type="checkbox">
    <input type="color">
    <input type="date">
    <input type="datetime-local">
    <input type="email">
    <input type="file">
    <input type="month">
    <input type="number">
    <input type="password">
    <input type="radio">
    <input type="range">
    <input type="search">
    <input type="tel">
    <input type="text">
    <input type="time">
    <input type="url">
    <input type="week">
    <meter>
    <progress>
    <select>
    <textarea>

Proper use of labels with the elements above will benefit:

Screen reader users (will read out loud the label, when the user is focused on the element)
Users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as checkboxes) - because when a user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the input (this increases the hit area).

Tip: The for attribute of <label> must be equal to the id attribute of the related element to bind them together.Â A label can also be bound to an element by placing the element inside the <label> element. -->
    <form action="/action_page.php">
      <input type="radio" id="html" name="fav_language" value="HTML" />
      <label for="html">HTML</label><br />
      <input type="radio" id="css" name="fav_language" value="CSS" />
      <label for="css">CSS</label><br />
      <input
        type="radio"
        id="javascript"
        name="fav_language"
        value="JavaScript"
      />
      <label for="javascript">JavaScript</label><br /><br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
    <!-- Defines an image map.
The <map> tag is used to define an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas.

The required name attribute of the <map> element is associated with the <img>'s usemap attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map.

The <map> element contains a number of <area> elements, that defines the clickable areas in the image map. -->
    <img
      src="./samplePictures/workplace.jpg"
      alt="Workplace"
      usemap="#workmap"
      width="400"
      height="379"
    />

    <map name="workmap">
      <area
        shape="rect"
        coords="34,44,270,350"
        alt="Computer"
        href="computer.htm"
      />
      <area
        shape="rect"
        coords="290,172,333,250"
        alt="Phone"
        href="phone.htm"
      />
      <area
        shape="circle"
        coords="337,300,44"
        alt="Cup of coffee"
        href="coffee.htm"
      />
    </map>
    <!-- Defines a container for an external application.
The <object> tag defines a container for an external resource.

The external resource can be a web page, a picture, a media player, or a plug-in application.

To embed a picture, it is better to use the <img> tag.

To embed HTML, it is better to use the <iframe> tag.

To embed video or audio, it is better to use the <video> and <audio> tags.
 -->
    <object
      data="./samplePictures/Desert.jpg"
      width="300"
      height="200"
    ></object>
    <object
      data="http://127.0.0.1:5500/inlineElements.html"
      width="500"
      height="200"
    ></object>
    <object data="video.mp4" width="400" height="300"></object>
    <!-- Defines the result of a calculation.
The <output> tag is used to represent the result of a calculation (like one performed by a script). -->
    <form oninput="x.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
      <input type="range" id="a" value="50" />
      +<input type="number" id="b" value="25" /> =<output
        name="x"
        for="a b"
      ></output>
    </form>
    <!-- Defines a short quotation.
The <q> tag defines a short quotation.

Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

Tip: Use <blockquote> for long quotations. -->
    <p>
      WWF's goal is to:
      <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q>
      We hope they succeed.
    </p>
    <!-- Defines sample output from a computer program.
The <samp> tag is used to define sample output from a computer program. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Tip: This tag is not deprecated. However, it is possible to achieve richer effect by using CSS.

Also look at:
Tag 	Description
<code> 	Defines a piece of computer code
<kbd> 	Defines keyboard input
<var> 	Defines a variable
<pre> 	Defines preformatted text -->
    <p>Message from my computer:</p>

    <p>
      <samp>File not found.<br />Press F1 to continue</samp>
    </p>
    <!-- Defines a client-side script.
The <script> tag is used to embed a client-side script (JavaScript).

The <script> element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.

Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.

Tip: Also look at the <noscript> element for users that have disabled scripts in their browser, or have a browser that doesn't support client-side scripting.

Tip: If you want to learn more about JavaScript, visit our JavaScript Tutorial. -->
    <h1>The script element</h1>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
    </script>
    <!-- Defines a drop-down list.
    The <select> element is used to create a drop-down list.

The <select> element is most often used in a form, to collect user input.

The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the drop-down list will be submitted).

The id attribute is needed to associate the drop-down list with a label.

The <option> tags inside the <select> element define the available options in the drop-down list.

Tip: Always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices! -->
    <label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>

    <select name="cars" id="cars">
      <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
      <option value="saab">Saab</option>
      <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
      <option value="audi">Audi</option>
    </select>
    <!-- Defines a section in a document.
The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.

The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element. -->
    <p>My mother has <span style="color: blue">blue</span> eyes.</p>
    <!-- Defines important text.
The <strong> tag is used to define text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

Tip: Use the <b> tag to specify bold text without any extra importance! -->
    <strong>This text is important!</strong>
    <!-- Defines subscripted text.
The <sub> tag defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O.

Tip: Use the <sup> tag to define superscripted text. -->
    <p>This text contains <sub>subscript</sub> text.</p>
    <!-- Defines superscripted text.
The <sup> tag defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1].

Tip: Use the <sub> tag to define subscript text. -->
    <p>This text contains <sup>superscript</sup> text.</p>
    <!-- Defines a multiline input control (text area).
The <textarea> tag defines a multi-line text input control.

The <textarea> element is often used in a form, to collect user inputs like comments or reviews.

A text area can hold an unlimited number of characters, and the text renders in a fixed-width font (usually Courier).

The size of a text area is specified by the cols and rows attributes (or with CSS).

The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the text area will be submitted).

The id attribute is needed to associate the text area with a label.Â 

Tip: Always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices! -->
    <label for="w3review">Review of W3Schools:</label>

    <textarea id="w3review" name="w3review" rows="4" cols="50">
    At w3schools.com you will learn how to make a website. They offer free tutorials in all web development technologies.
    </textarea>
    <!-- Defines a specific time (or datetime).
The <time> tag defines a specific time (or datetime).

The datetime attribute of this element is used translate the time into a machine-readable format so that browsers can offer to add date reminders through the user's calendar, and search engines can produce smarter search results. -->
    <p>Open from <time>10:00</time> to <time>21:00</time> every weekday.</p>
