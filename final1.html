                <p style="font-family: georgia,garamond,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">
                    My name is Aritry Samaddar. I am from Asansol, West Bengal. I have four members in my family including me, my parents & my elder sister.
                    I love music and read books in my free times. Besides all these I love travelling a lot, though I don't get much time for travelling now-a-days because of my busy work-life. But I need to visit atleast one place in a year. My dad made me travel many places since childhood. But I never done any solo trip till now, hope I would in future.
                    I love connecting with people, talk to different persons and get to know them and their way of living life. People from different places becomes another bonus to my interest. I learn a lot of things this way, I believe the most we can learn is from people, from people who spreads positivity in this world.
                    That's all about me. Hope you enjoy my web-page.

                <p style="font-family: georgia,garamond,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic;">
                    The Dooars or Duars are the foothills of the eastern Himalayas in North-East India around Bhutan. Duar means door and the region forms the gateway to Bhutan from India. There are 18 passages or gateways through which the Bhutanese people can communicate with the people living in the plains. This region is divided by the Sankosh River into the Eastern and the Western Dooars. The Western Dooars is known as the Bengal Dooars and the Eastern Dooars as the Assam Dooars. Dooars is synonymous with the term Terai used in Nepal and northern India and form the only nitrate rich plain in India. The Dooars region politically constitutes the plains of Darjeeling Himalayas, the whole of Jalpaiguri district and Alipurduar district. The altitude of Dooars area ranges from 90 to 1,750 m. Innumerable streams and rivers flow through these fertile plains from the mountains of Bhutan. The major river is the Teesta besides many others like the Jaldhaka, Murti, Torsa, Sankosh, Dyna, Karatoya, Raidak, and Kaljani rivers, among others. Monsoon generally starts from the middle of May and continues till the end of September. Winters are cold with foggy mornings and nights. Summer is mild and constitutes a very short period of the year. Dooars is the ideal place in Bengal for monsoon travelling. The economy of Dooars is based on three "T"s - Tea, Tourism and Timber. The main industry of the Dooars region is the tea industry. Thousands of people are engaged in the tea estates and factories. Several people are also engaged in the cultivation of betel nuts which contributes to the economy. Cultivation of other crops is done mainly for local consumption. The area is dotted by several national parks and wildlife sanctuaries which attract a lot of tourists from all over India and abroad, making it an important contributor to the economy and also employer of a number of people. The timber industry, flourishes in this region. A number of saw mills, plywood industries and other allied business also act as an important contributor to the economy. Dooars act as a doorway to Bhutan; thus, export-import industry also flourishes in the area. The towns of Jaigaon, Siliguri and Phuntsholing are important hubs of the export-import industry.

                    Uttarakhand has everything except the sea. India, Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean cover the area once occupied by the Tethys ocean, and Turkey, Iraq, and Tibet sit on Cimmeria. What was once the Tethys Sea has become the Mediterranean sea. But discovery of the Ammonite fossils in the upper reaches of Himalayas, in Nanda Devi are suggestive of the fact that area was perhaps submerged under Tethys Sea in the geological past.
